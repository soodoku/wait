1. Based on the variance in the wait times during the days, it seems the staffing is suboptimal. 

## DMV Field Offices
It looks like there are approximately 163 DMV field offices in CA (scraper wasn't able to find any more). This number does however seem to be backed up elsewhere. https://yogov.org/dmv/california/california-dmv-locations/ estimates ~180 field offices. It's possible I've missed a couple in scraping. Will think through how I might determine if this is the case.
